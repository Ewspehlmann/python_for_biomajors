'''
BMI = Weight(KG)/Height(M)^2


convert np array into bmi then use boolean expressions to show
weather someone is under,normal, or over
lets use these arbitrary classifications 


under = BMI<20
Normal = BMI>20 | BMI <30
Over = BMI >30 

Loop through your list printing the BMI and printing its classification

heightCM = [172,180,150,190,200]
KG = [70,98,75,100,70]
use these lists to make a np.array
'''
import numpy as np

#heightCM = np.array() # use these numbers to calculate the BMI
#KG = np.array()

BMIlist = Weight(KG)/Height(M)^2 #hint to get to meters from cm multiply by a hundreth 

# for  in BMIlist:
    #condtions
